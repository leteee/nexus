# Default Camera Calibration for Roof-Mounted Camera
# This is a reasonable default for a vehicle roof-mounted forward-facing camera
# Coordinate system: Vehicle ADS (ego) coordinates
#   X: forward, Y: left, Z: up

camera:
  name: "roof_forward_camera"

  # Image resolution
  resolution:
    width: 1920
    height: 1080

  # Intrinsic parameters (camera matrix)
  # These define the camera's optical properties
  intrinsics:
    # Focal length in pixels (fx, fy)
    # Calculated for ~60° horizontal FOV: fx = width / (2 * tan(FOV_h/2))
    # fx = 1920 / (2 * tan(30°)) ≈ 1663
    fx: 1663.0
    fy: 1663.0

    # Principal point (optical center, usually image center)
    cx: 960.0   # width / 2
    cy: 540.0   # height / 2

    # Distortion coefficients (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3)
    # Set to zero for simplified model
    distortion: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

  # Extrinsic parameters (camera pose in vehicle coordinate system)
  # Translation: camera position relative to vehicle origin (rear axle center)
  # Rotation: camera orientation
  extrinsics:
    # Camera position in vehicle frame (meters)
    # X: 2.5m forward from rear axle
    # Y: 0.0m (centered)
    # Z: 1.8m above ground
    translation:
      x: 2.5
      y: 0.0
      z: 1.8

    # Camera orientation (Euler angles in degrees)
    # Roll: 0° (no side tilt)
    # Pitch: -10° (tilted down to see road ahead)
    # Yaw: 0° (facing forward)
    rotation:
      roll: 0.0
      pitch: -10.0
      yaw: 0.0
